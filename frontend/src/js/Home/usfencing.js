                            The legislation around the registration as an Electric Fence System Installer (EFSI) is contained in Regulations 12-15 of the Electrical Machinery Regulations. Electric fence installations may only be performed, and a Certificate of Compliance (COC) issued, by persons registered as EFSIs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) course addresses the gap between Installation Electricians (IE) and Fence Installers. It is designed for individuals who have been in the electric fence installation field for over two years. The aim is to qualify Electric Fence Installers with the Energy and Water Sector Education and Training Authority (EWSETA) and assist them in registering with the Department of Labour.
